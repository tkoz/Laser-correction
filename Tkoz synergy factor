Normalize the metrics using min-max normalization technique:
N_i = (x_i - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x) + epsilon)

Calculate the harmonic mean:
HM = n / sum(1/(N_i + epsilon))

Apply logarithmic scaling:
Log_HM = log(1 + HM)

Calculate interaction effects using a regression model:
IE = b1N1 + b2N2 + ... + bnNn

Assign weights to each metric based on their importance in evaluating the system's synergy:
SF = w1N1 + w2N2 + ... + wnNn + IE

Apply logarithmic exponential scaling to further amplify the effect of high-performing materials and suppress the effect of low-performing materials:
SF = exp(a * Log_HM)


N_i = (x_i - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x) + epsilon)
HM = n / sum(1/(N_i + epsilon))
Log_HM = log(1 + HM)
IE = b1N1 + b2N2 + ... + bnNn
SF = w1N1 + w2N2 + ... + wnNn + IE
SF = exp(a * Log_HM)
